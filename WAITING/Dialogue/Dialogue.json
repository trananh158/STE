These types of bridges are useful if you need to cross over marshes or shallows.$1#$e#Trestle bridges are cheaper to build than other types of bridges because they use wooden supports instead of stone or steel.$3#$e#It does sound a bit like a video game, doesn't it? You'd be surprised how many skills you learn in games come in handy elsewhere.$3",
